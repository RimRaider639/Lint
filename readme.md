## /products

### Routes:

- **Open routes**:

1. `GET` / : get all products

- **Restricted routes**:

1. `GET` /add : to add whatever is in the db.json in the products collection
2. `GET` /removeall : to remove all documents from products collection

### Features:

- Use with `page` and `limit` query when getting all products, else it'll take over a minute to get all the data.

* Any key in the product can be used as a filter.

* Query `category` can be used to filter 0th index of category tree array. Similarly `subCategory`, `sub2Category` & `sub3Category` can be used to filter 1st, 2nd & 3rd index of the category tree array simultaneously.

```

```

- For sorting by a field, pass the field in the query `sort`. The query `order` takes asc or desc to sort in ascending (default) or descending order respectively.

```
https://wide-eyed-pinafore-duck.cyclic.app/products?page=1&limit=100&sort=discounted_price&order=asc
```

- Use a query with the suffix `_like` to find results with similar values for that key. This is case sensitive.

```

## Routes:

- /users

## /products

### Routes:

- **Open routes**:

1. `GET /` : get all products
2. `GET /:id` : get a product by its ID

- **Admin Routes:**

1. `POST /` : create a new product
2. `PATCH /:id` : update a product by its ID
3. `DELETE /:id` : delete a product

- **Restricted routes**:

1. `GET /add` : to add whatever is in the db.json in the products collection
2. `GET /removeAll` : to remove all documents from products collection

### Features:

#### `GET /`

- Use with `limit` query, else it'll take over a minute to get all the data. `page` and `limit` queries can be used for pagination.

```
https://wide-eyed-pinafore-duck.cyclic.app/products?page=1&limit=100
```

- Any key in the product can be used as a filter.

- Query `category` can be used to filter 0th index of category tree array. Similarly `subCategory`, `sub2Category` & `sub3Category` can be used to filter 1st, 2nd & 3rd index of the category tree array simultaneously.

```
https://wide-eyed-pinafore-duck.cyclic.app/products?category=Computers&sub2Category=Bags&page=1&limit=100
```

- For sorting by a field, pass the field in the query `sort`. The query `order` takes asc or desc to sort in ascending (default) or descending order respectively.

```
https://wide-eyed-pinafore-duck.cyclic.app/products?page=1&limit=100&sort=discounted_price&order=asc
```

- Use a query with the suffix `_like` to find results with similar values for that key. This is case sensitive.

```

```
